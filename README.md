# Claudemon

Claudemon is a native macOS menu-bar app that shows your **Claude Code
subscription usage live**. It reads the same limits the Claude Code CLI reports
and surfaces them in three places:

- a compact gauge + session percentage in the **menu bar** (with a
  configurable style — icon + text, text only, or icon only),
- an optional always-on-top **floating desktop window** (double-click to toggle
  a **mini session-only view**), and
- a **Notification Center / desktop widget** (WidgetKit).

It tracks the three limits Claude Code reports — **Current Session (5h)**,
**Current Week (all models)**, and a **per-model current-week limit** (the
label follows whichever model Anthropic is currently tracking there, e.g.
**Current Week (Fable)** — this replaced the older **Current Week (Sonnet
only)** wording after Anthropic added the Fable model) — each with a labeled
progress bar, the percent used, a `resets in Xh Ym` countdown, and the
absolute reset time in the limit's own timezone.

## Screenshots

The floating window has two forms: the **full view** (session ring + weekly bars
+ reset footer) and a **mini view** that shows just the session ring. **Double-click
the floating window** to switch between them — the mini view is a smaller,
glanceable indicator that stays out of the way; double-click again to return.

## Menu bar style & settings

The menu bar fills up fast, so Claudemon lets you choose how much room its item
takes. Open the panel and click the **⚙︎ gear** in the header to reveal the
settings, then pick a **Menu bar style**:

| Style | Shows | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Icon + Text** | gauge icon + session percent (e.g. `◐ 28%`) | Default |
| **Text only** | just the percent (`28%`) | Smallest footprint that still shows the number |
| **Icon only** | just the gauge icon | Tightest footprint |

Your choice is remembered across launches.

The panel itself opens **clean** — usage data plus **Refresh** / **Quit** only.
The **⚙︎ gear** in the panel header reveals (and hides) the settings section:
**Menu bar style**, **Floating widget**, **Launch at login**, and **Usage
alerts**. Settings stay collapsed by default so the everyday glance is
uncluttered.

> The menu-bar item can only show the gauge icon and/or the percent — macOS's
> `MenuBarExtra` doesn't allow custom font sizes or colored labels there. The
> in-panel usage bars and the floating/desktop widgets keep their green / yellow
> / red coloring as before.

## Requirements

Please read this before installing — most "it didn't work" reports come from a
missing prerequisite.

- **macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later.**
- **The Claude Code CLI must be installed _and_ signed in to your own Claude
  subscription.** Claudemon does not call any Anthropic API itself — it runs the
  `claude` CLI locally and reads its output. It therefore shows **your own**
  signed-in usage, not anyone else's.
- Claudemon auto-detects the `claude` binary across the common install layouts.
  GUI apps on macOS do not inherit your shell `PATH`, so it resolves `claude` by
  absolute path, checking (in priority order):
  - `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude` (Homebrew) and `/usr/local/bin/claude`
  - `~/.claude/local/claude` (the official local installer)
  - `~/.local/bin/claude`
  - `~/.npm-global/bin/claude` (npm global)
  - `~/Library/pnpm/claude` (pnpm)
  - `~/.volta/bin/claude` (Volta)
  - `~/.asdf/shims/claude` (asdf)
  - per-version directories under `~/.nvm/versions/node` and `~/.fnm`
    (nvm / fnm)
  - finally, a login-shell `command -v claude` fallback (zsh, then bash) so any
    other PATH set in your shell rc files is honored.

If `claude` is not installed, Claudemon shows a calm in-app prompt with the
install command and a link rather than failing silently:

```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

(The panel also links to <https://claude.ai/download>.) If `claude` is installed
but not signed in, the panel tells you to run `claude` in a terminal and use
`/login`.

## Install (for end users / friends)

### Homebrew (recommended)

```sh
brew install --cask ardabalkandev/tap/claudemon
```

This taps [`ardabalkandev/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/ardabalkandev/homebrew-tap)
and installs the same Developer ID signed + notarized app. Update later with
`brew upgrade --cask claudemon`, or remove it completely with
`brew uninstall --zap --cask claudemon`.

> **Note:** From Homebrew 5.2.0/6.0.0 onward (whichever comes first), third-party
> taps require explicit trust. The fully-qualified command above is unaffected and
> keeps working with no extra steps. If you prefer the `brew tap ardabalkandev/tap`
> + short-name workflow, run `brew trust --cask ardabalkandev/tap/claudemon` first.
> See [Tap Trust](https://docs.brew.sh/Tap-Trust) for details.

### Manual (DMG)

1. Download `Claudemon.dmg` from the
   [GitHub Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Open the DMG. A window appears with the **Claudemon** icon and an
   **Applications** folder.
3. Drag **Claudemon** onto **Applications**.
4. Launch Claudemon from Applications (or Launchpad).

There is **no Dock icon** — Claudemon lives in the **menu bar** (top-right of the
screen). Look for the gauge with a session percentage, e.g. `◐ 28%`. Click it to
open the panel; click the **⚙︎ gear** in the panel header to reveal the settings,
where you can choose the menu bar style, toggle the floating window, and enable
"Launch at login." Once the floating window is on screen, **double-click it** to
switch between the full and mini views.

Because the app is notarized by Apple, it opens without a Gatekeeper warning. If
macOS still complains (for example after copying it via an unusual route),
**right-click the app → Open**, then confirm once.

To add the widget, right-click the desktop or open Notification Center →
**Edit Widgets**, find **Claude Usage**, and place it.

## How it works

When running, Claudemon runs the CLI roughly every 60 seconds:

```bash
claude -p "/usage" --output-format json
```

It decodes the outer JSON, reads the `.result` field (a newline-delimited,
human-readable string), and tolerantly parses the three usage lines, e.g.:

```
Current session: 28% used · resets Jun 24 at 2:49am (Europe/Istanbul)
Current week (all models): 29% used · resets Jun 26 at 9:59am (Europe/Istanbul)
Current week (Fable): 2% used · resets Jun 26 at 10am (Europe/Istanbul)
```

The third line's model name is read from the text, not hardcoded — Anthropic
has already renamed it once (from "Sonnet only" to "Fable") as the model
lineup changed, and Claudemon will keep tracking whatever name appears there
without needing an update.

The reset year is not present in the text, so Claudemon infers the nearest
future occurrence using each line's IANA timezone (e.g. `Europe/Istanbul`).

A single `UsageStore` owns one 60-second polling timer (with an immediate
refresh on launch) and is the single source of truth observed by both the menu
bar and the floating window — so **both are genuinely live**. The subprocess
runs off the main thread with a ~15s timeout, so the UI never blocks. If
`claude` is missing, errors, times out, or its output can't be parsed,
Claudemon shows a clear error/onboarding state, keeps the last good values, and
keeps polling. Polling pauses on system sleep and resumes on wake.

### The widget (App Group bridge)

WidgetKit extensions are sandboxed and cannot run `claude` or hit the network.
Instead, the app writes each successful poll to a JSON cache in the shared App
Group container (`3QKMW9HR59.group.com.claudemon.app`), and the widget reads
**only** from that cache. Both targets carry the App Group entitlement
(`Support/Claudemon.entitlements`, `Support/ClaudemonWidget.entitlements`).
Because the main app is non-sandboxed, this data bridge only works in the
signed/notarized build — an ad-hoc local build cannot share the App Group
container, so the widget will stay on its "Open Claudemon" prompt there.

The widget is **best-effort fresh, not per-minute.** Apple throttles widget
timeline reloads, so Claudemon rate-limits them and the widget's own timeline
policy targets roughly every 15 minutes. The menu bar and floating window remain
the genuinely live (60s) surfaces; the widget is a glance view that shows
"as of HH:mm" from the cache timestamp (and an "Open Claudemon" prompt when the
cache is empty).

## Build from source

You need **Xcode** on macOS 14+. The deployment target is **macOS 14.0**.

### Open the Xcode project (canonical)

The shippable product — the menu-bar app **plus** the WidgetKit extension and
the shared framework — is built from `Claudemon.xcodeproj`, which is committed
to the repo.

```bash
open Claudemon.xcodeproj
```

> Open `Claudemon.xcodeproj` **in Xcode**, not the bare folder. Opening the
> folder would load it as a Swift Package (via `Package.swift`) and miss the
> widget and entitlements.

The project defines four targets:

| Target            | Type               | Role                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Claudemon`       | macOS app          | Menu-bar app (UI, AppKit glue, the fetch engine)            |
| `ClaudemonWidget` | App extension      | WidgetKit widget (reads only the App Group cache)           |
| `ClaudemonCore`   | Framework          | Shared, network-free model + parser + cache + colors        |
| `ClaudemonTests`  | Unit-test bundle   | Parser / model / cache / locator tests (links the core)     |

### Run the unit tests (SwiftPM)

A `Package.swift` is kept so the shared core and tests can be built and run from
the command line without Xcode. This path covers `ClaudemonCore`, the app
target, and the tests — it does **not** include the widget or App Group
entitlements.

```bash
swift build   # debug build of ClaudemonCore + the app
swift test    # runs the unit test suite (currently 87 tests)
```

### XcodeGen (optional regeneration fallback)

`project.yml` is an [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) spec kept
as optional documentation and a regeneration fallback. The `.xcodeproj` is the
source you open day to day; only run this if you need to rebuild it:

```bash
xcodegen generate   # regenerates Claudemon.xcodeproj from project.yml
```

## Release / signing (building the signed DMG)

`scripts/release-dmg.sh` produces a Developer ID signed + notarized + stapled
`dist/Claudemon.dmg` for sharing outside the App Store:

```bash
./scripts/release-dmg.sh
```

The pipeline:

1. `xcodegen generate` + `xcodebuild` Release (codesigning is **off** at build
   time, so no provisioning profile is needed during the build).
2. Sign inside-out with the **Developer ID Application** identity, **Hardened
   Runtime** (`--options runtime`) and a secure `--timestamp`, applying each
   target's entitlements: framework → widget appex → app.
3. Verify signatures (`codesign --verify --deep --strict`).
4. Notarize the app (`xcrun notarytool submit --wait`), then staple and
   validate.
5. Build a drag-to-install DMG (app + `Applications` symlink), sign it, then
   notarize + staple the DMG.
6. Gatekeeper assessment (`spctl`).

Prerequisites on the build machine:

- A **paid Apple Developer account**.
- A **Developer ID Application** certificate in the keychain.
- A `notarytool` keychain profile named **`claudemon`**. (Override it with
  `NOTARY_PROFILE=<name> ./scripts/release-dmg.sh`.) No secrets are stored in
  this repo — the script references the profile by name only.

## Known limitations

- **Only updates while running.** Claudemon has no background daemon; the
  numbers refresh only while the app is open.
- The widget is **best-effort fresh, not per-minute** — Apple throttles widget
  refreshes.
- Requires the **Claude Code CLI installed and signed in** to an active Claude
  subscription.
- Requires **macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later**.
- The `/usage` text is free-form. The parser is tolerant, but if Anthropic
  changes the wording substantially, Claudemon will fail soft into an error
  state rather than crash.

## Privacy

All usage data stays on your machine. Claudemon runs the `claude` CLI locally
and reads its output; it does not collect, transmit, or share your usage data.
The only app-initiated network request is the **Check for Updates** call to
GitHub Releases (automatic at most once per day, and when you click the button),
which sends a standard HTTPS request with the app version as its User-Agent and
has **no telemetry**.
