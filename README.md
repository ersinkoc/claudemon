# Claudemon

Claudemon is a native macOS menu-bar app that shows your **Claude Code
subscription usage live**. It reads the same limits the Claude Code CLI reports
and surfaces them in three places:

- a compact gauge + session percentage in the **menu bar**,
- an optional always-on-top **floating desktop window**, and
- a **Notification Center / desktop widget** (WidgetKit).

It tracks the three limits Claude Code reports — **Current Session (5h)**,
**Current Week (all models)**, and **Current Week (Sonnet only)** — each with a
labeled progress bar, the percent used, a `resets in Xh Ym` countdown, and the
absolute reset time in the limit's own timezone.

## Requirements

Please read this before installing — most "it didn't work" reports come from a
missing prerequisite.

- **macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later.**
- **The Claude Code CLI must be installed _and_ signed in to your own Claude
  subscription.** Claudemon does not call any Anthropic API itself — it runs the
  `claude` CLI locally and reads its output. It therefore shows **your own**
  signed-in usage, not anyone else's.
- Claudemon auto-detects the `claude` binary across the common install layouts.
  GUI apps on macOS do not inherit your shell `PATH`, so it resolves `claude` by
  absolute path, checking (in priority order):
  - `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude` (Homebrew) and `/usr/local/bin/claude`
  - `~/.claude/local/claude` (the official local installer)
  - `~/.local/bin/claude`
  - `~/.npm-global/bin/claude` (npm global)
  - `~/Library/pnpm/claude` (pnpm)
  - `~/.volta/bin/claude` (Volta)
  - `~/.asdf/shims/claude` (asdf)
  - per-version directories under `~/.nvm/versions/node` and `~/.fnm`
    (nvm / fnm)
  - finally, a login-shell `command -v claude` fallback (zsh, then bash) so any
    other PATH set in your shell rc files is honored.

If `claude` is not installed, Claudemon shows a calm in-app prompt with the
install command and a link rather than failing silently:

```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

(The panel also links to <https://claude.ai/download>.) If `claude` is installed
but not signed in, the panel tells you to run `claude` in a terminal and use
`/login`.

## Install (for end users / friends)

1. Download `Claudemon.dmg` from the
   [GitHub Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Open the DMG. A window appears with the **Claudemon** icon and an
   **Applications** folder.
3. Drag **Claudemon** onto **Applications**.
4. Launch Claudemon from Applications (or Launchpad).

There is **no Dock icon** — Claudemon lives in the **menu bar** (top-right of the
screen). Look for the gauge with a session percentage, e.g. `◐ 28%`. Click it to
open the full panel, where you can toggle the floating window and "Launch at
login."

Because the app is notarized by Apple, it opens without a Gatekeeper warning. If
macOS still complains (for example after copying it via an unusual route),
**right-click the app → Open**, then confirm once.

To add the widget, right-click the desktop or open Notification Center →
**Edit Widgets**, find **Claude Usage**, and place it.

## How it works

When running, Claudemon runs the CLI roughly every 60 seconds:

```bash
claude -p "/usage" --output-format json
```

It decodes the outer JSON, reads the `.result` field (a newline-delimited,
human-readable string), and tolerantly parses the three usage lines, e.g.:

```
Current session: 28% used · resets Jun 24 at 2:49am (Europe/Istanbul)
Current week (all models): 29% used · resets Jun 26 at 9:59am (Europe/Istanbul)
Current week (Sonnet only): 2% used · resets Jun 26 at 10am (Europe/Istanbul)
```

The reset year is not present in the text, so Claudemon infers the nearest
future occurrence using each line's IANA timezone (e.g. `Europe/Istanbul`).

A single `UsageStore` owns one 60-second polling timer (with an immediate
refresh on launch) and is the single source of truth observed by both the menu
bar and the floating window — so **both are genuinely live**. The subprocess
runs off the main thread with a ~15s timeout, so the UI never blocks. If
`claude` is missing, errors, times out, or its output can't be parsed,
Claudemon shows a clear error/onboarding state, keeps the last good values, and
keeps polling. Polling pauses on system sleep and resumes on wake.

### The widget (App Group bridge)

WidgetKit extensions are sandboxed and cannot run `claude` or hit the network.
Instead, the app writes each successful poll to a JSON cache in the shared App
Group container (`group.com.claudemon.app`), and the widget reads **only** from
that cache. Both targets carry the App Group entitlement
(`Support/Claudemon.entitlements`, `Support/ClaudemonWidget.entitlements`).

The widget is **best-effort fresh, not per-minute.** Apple throttles widget
timeline reloads, so Claudemon rate-limits them and the widget's own timeline
policy targets roughly every 15 minutes. The menu bar and floating window remain
the genuinely live (60s) surfaces; the widget is a glance view that shows
"as of HH:mm" from the cache timestamp (and an "Open Claudemon" prompt when the
cache is empty).

## Build from source

You need **Xcode** on macOS 14+. The deployment target is **macOS 14.0**.

### Open the Xcode project (canonical)

The shippable product — the menu-bar app **plus** the WidgetKit extension and
the shared framework — is built from `Claudemon.xcodeproj`, which is committed
to the repo.

```bash
open Claudemon.xcodeproj
```

> Open `Claudemon.xcodeproj` **in Xcode**, not the bare folder. Opening the
> folder would load it as a Swift Package (via `Package.swift`) and miss the
> widget and entitlements.

The project defines four targets:

| Target            | Type               | Role                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Claudemon`       | macOS app          | Menu-bar app (UI, AppKit glue, the fetch engine)            |
| `ClaudemonWidget` | App extension      | WidgetKit widget (reads only the App Group cache)           |
| `ClaudemonCore`   | Framework          | Shared, network-free model + parser + cache + colors        |
| `ClaudemonTests`  | Unit-test bundle   | Parser / model / cache / locator tests (links the core)     |

### Run the unit tests (SwiftPM)

A `Package.swift` is kept so the shared core and tests can be built and run from
the command line without Xcode. This path covers `ClaudemonCore`, the app
target, and the tests — it does **not** include the widget or App Group
entitlements.

```bash
swift build   # debug build of ClaudemonCore + the app
swift test    # runs the unit test suite (currently 40 tests)
```

### XcodeGen (optional regeneration fallback)

`project.yml` is an [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) spec kept
as optional documentation and a regeneration fallback. The `.xcodeproj` is the
source you open day to day; only run this if you need to rebuild it:

```bash
xcodegen generate   # regenerates Claudemon.xcodeproj from project.yml
```

## Release / signing (building the signed DMG)

`scripts/release-dmg.sh` produces a Developer ID signed + notarized + stapled
`dist/Claudemon.dmg` for sharing outside the App Store:

```bash
./scripts/release-dmg.sh
```

The pipeline:

1. `xcodegen generate` + `xcodebuild` Release (codesigning is **off** at build
   time, so no provisioning profile is needed during the build).
2. Sign inside-out with the **Developer ID Application** identity, **Hardened
   Runtime** (`--options runtime`) and a secure `--timestamp`, applying each
   target's entitlements: framework → widget appex → app.
3. Verify signatures (`codesign --verify --deep --strict`).
4. Notarize the app (`xcrun notarytool submit --wait`), then staple and
   validate.
5. Build a drag-to-install DMG (app + `Applications` symlink), sign it, then
   notarize + staple the DMG.
6. Gatekeeper assessment (`spctl`).

Prerequisites on the build machine:

- A **paid Apple Developer account**.
- A **Developer ID Application** certificate in the keychain.
- A `notarytool` keychain profile named **`claudemon`**. (Override it with
  `NOTARY_PROFILE=<name> ./scripts/release-dmg.sh`.) No secrets are stored in
  this repo — the script references the profile by name only.

## Known limitations

- **Only updates while running.** Claudemon has no background daemon; the
  numbers refresh only while the app is open.
- The widget is **best-effort fresh, not per-minute** — Apple throttles widget
  refreshes.
- Requires the **Claude Code CLI installed and signed in** to an active Claude
  subscription.
- Requires **macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later**.
- The `/usage` text is free-form. The parser is tolerant, but if Anthropic
  changes the wording substantially, Claudemon will fail soft into an error
  state rather than crash.

## Privacy

All data stays on your machine. Claudemon only runs the `claude` CLI locally and
reads its output; it makes **no network calls of its own** and has **no
telemetry**. It does not collect, transmit, or share any of your data.

## Disclaimer

Claudemon is an **unofficial, third-party tool**. It is **not affiliated with,
endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic**. "Claude" and "Claude Code" are
trademarks of Anthropic. Claudemon simply reads the output of the official
`claude` CLI that you install and sign in to yourself.
